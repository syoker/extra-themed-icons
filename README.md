# Extra Themed Icons

This Magisk Module adds more icons either lines or filled (you can choose) than a normal Pixel Launcher.
> **NOTES:**
> - These icons are not mine (the credits will be below, I only make the module.
> - I recommend disabling and enabling the thematic icons so that the module is well applied.
